<h3>Description</h3>
<p>What we have here is a fast, cheap, and easy recipe. While this<br>
may remind some people of a fried rice dish, this is significantly<br> 
lighter and very low onf at content.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain rice</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 (7 ounce) jar tuna packed in olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup finely diced jalapeno pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup finely sliced green onions</li>
    <li>1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1/2 lemon, juiced, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 pinch Korean red pepper flakes(gochugaru), or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon finely sliced green onion, or to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pour rice into a heavy pot and add water; swirl to allow rice to settle.<br>
    Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; do not stir. Reduce heat to<br> low, cover,
    and continue to simmer for 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>While rice is cooking, place tuna into a large mixing bowl and break up<br> with your
    hands or a fork. Toss in red bell pepper, jalapeno, 1/4 cup green onions,<br> rice vinegar,
    lemon juice, soy sauce, Sriracha, and sesame oil. Mix with a fork until<br> thoroughly combined.
    </li>
    <li>Turn off heat and let rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fluff rice with a fork to separate the grains and break up any large clumps; transfer<br> into
    the mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly with a spoon until all the ingredients are evenly<br> incorporated.
    Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve warm, at room temperature,<br> or cold like a rice salad,
    topped with red pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon green onion.</li>
</ol>
